# New Portsmouth Weather Bot

A bespoke weather bot for the Anima Mundi roleplay server.

# Intended features
- can either automatically post weather reports on a schedule, or manually post weather reports via a command
- Toggle between 'auto' mode and 'manual' mode (note: toggle would be awesome just because sometimes mods may want to lock it to a specific weather event)
- Weather delivered as weekly summaries of weather that are somewhat vague, instead of daily 'absolutes' (as Anima Mundi is not run in real-time, we don't want the bot to run in real time)
- Base the weather patterns off Sequim, WA
- Base code off this weather bot here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63486570/how-to-make-a-weather-command-using-discord-py-v1-4-1
- potentially an option to preview queued weather events? and also an option to edit or delete weather events
- allow mods to schedule weather events for specific dates in advance
